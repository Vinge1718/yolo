# 🛠️ Stage 1: Ansible-based E-commerce App Deployment

## 📦 Description
This project automates the deployment of a containerized e-commerce application using Ansible and Docker, provisioned inside a Vagrant-based Ubuntu VM.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Ansible
- Docker
- Vagrant
- Ubuntu 20.04

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

```bash
# Start VM
vagrant up

# SSH into VM
vagrant ssh

# Run playbook
ansible-playbook /vagrant/playbook.yml

# DevOps Final Assignment

## Stage 1 (Ansible + Vagrant)
- `vagrant up` creates a VM.
- Ansible installs Docker, Docker Compose, and runs the app.
- Follows best practices (roles + variables).

## Stage 2 (Terraform + Ansible)
- Terraform generates inventory, triggers Ansible.
- Ansible sets up services and launches Dockerized app.
- Infrastructure and configuration are fully automated.

## Application URL
- http://192.168.56.10:PORT


# 🚀 Stage Two – DevOps Project Deployment (Terraform + Docker)

## 📌 Overview

This document outlines the **Stage Two** implementation of the DevOps project. In this stage, we added infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**, integrated it with Docker containers, and ensured clean DevOps practices such as modular code, parameterization, and Git versioning via a second branch.

---

## 🛠️ Branching Strategy

To separate Stage One from Stage Two, a new Git branch was created:

```bash
git checkout -b stage_two
