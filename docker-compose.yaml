# This file builds the Docker images for a React/NodeJS application and runs it as microservices on Docker containers
# To ensure successful execution, clone this entire repository and execute this file while in the root folder of the cloned repository
# It's also a requirement to have Docker and the docker-compose plugin installed in your environment
# To launch this app without having to clone the entire repository, use the docker-compose.yaml file to run the app
